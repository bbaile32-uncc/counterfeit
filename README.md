# Counterfeit

**Counterfeit** is a first-person simulation game where you run a secret counterfeit money operation.  
Balance speed and risk as you print, wash, and package fake billsâ€”then cash them in without getting caught.  
Upgrading your equipment boosts profits, but each upgrade increases suspicion.

- **Print Money** â€“ Use your printer to produce counterfeit bills.
- **Wash & Clean** â€“ Run money through cleaning machines to reduce suspicion.
